<p>
  Zeus, in ancient Greek religion, chief deity of the pantheon, a sky and weather god who was 
  identical with the Roman god Jupiter. His name may be related to that of the sky god Dyaus of the 
  ancient Hindu Rigveda. Zeus was regarded as the sender of thunder and lightning, rain, and winds, and his 
  traditional weapon was the thunderbolt. He was called the father (i.e., the ruler and protector) of both gods and men.
